## To start:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

In terminal (with mongodb installed):

```
mongo
```

To start server:
```
npm startServer
```

To run in Android Studio, open an emulator, then in terminal:
```
react-native run-android
```

Be sure to replace 'ip' in 'constants' with your ip -- this is necessary as Android Studio doesn't seem to recognize 'localhost'
